# ChainVault: Unlocking Instant Bitcoin Liquidity

## Overview

ChainVault is a pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol developed on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) platform, designed to unlock instant liquidity for Bitcoin holders. By leveraging the seamless integration of ICP with the Bitcoin network, ChainVault enables users to use ckBTC as collateral to mint stablecoins, providing a secure and efficient solution for liquidity without compromising the inherent security of the Bitcoin network.

## Inspiration

The inception of ChainVault was motivated by the complexities and security concerns associated with converting Bitcoin into liquid assets. Traditional methods often compromise security or involve cumbersome bridging mechanisms. ChainVault addresses these challenges by offering a decentralized, secure, and user-friendly platform for Bitcoin liquidity.

## Key Features

- **Instant Liquidity Solutions:** Mint stablecoins against ckBTC collateral with ease.
- **BTC to ckBTC Conversion:** Direct BTC deposits are automatically converted to ckBTC, streamlining the process.
- **Compliance with ICRC-2 Standard:** Ensures compatibility and interoperability within the ICP ecosystem.
- **Vault Management System:** Users can effortlessly manage their vaults, loans, and collateral.
- **Robust Liquidation Mechanism:** Maintains the integrity of the system and the peg of the stablecoin.

## Architecture

ChainVault's architecture is built for robustness and scalability, utilizing the Azle framework (TypeScript) for the development of backend canisters. The system is composed of:

- **Oracle Canisters:** Provide up-to-date ckBTC price data.
- **Deposit Module:** Facilitates secure ckBTC or BTC deposits.
- **SynBase Canister:** Serves as the foundation for the ICRC-2 compatible stablecoins.
- **Minter Canister:** Manages the minting and burning processes of stablecoins.
- **Vault Manager Canister:** Central to managing user vaults, collateral, and loans.

The frontend is developed with NextJs, integrated with the Bitfinity wallet for a seamless user experience, emphasizing usability and design.
